//! # Parking Lot:
//!
//! Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.
//!
//! Hints: #258
//!
//! (Borrowing from CtCI's Solutions section for more context.)
//!
//! The wording of this question is vague, just as it would be in an actual interview.
//! This requires you to have a conversation with your interviewer about what types of vehicles it can support,
//! whether the parking lot has multiple levels, and so on.
//! For our purposes right now, we'll make the following assumptions.
//! We made these specific assumptions to add a bit of complexity to the problem without adding too much.
//! If you made different assumptions, that's totally fine.
//!
//! * The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
//! * The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses.
//! * The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.
//! * A motorcycle can park in any spot.
//! * A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
//! * A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.
//!

// In addition to being a wide-open question, we'll also be designing this [ParkingLot] in Rust,
// a language which wouldn't call itself object-oriented.
// This is actually a case where (the author thinks) Rust's algebraic enums work better than sub-classes.
