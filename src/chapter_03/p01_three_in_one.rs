//! # Three in One: 
//! 
//! Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks. 
//! 
//! Hints: #2, #72, #38, #58
//! 
//! FIXME: 
//! The book solutions include two approaches:
//! * (1) Fixed-size, which isn't super interesting
//! * (2) Variable-size, which includes this note here: 
//! 
//! ```text
//! Please note that the code for this solution is far more complex than would be appropriate for an interview. 
//! You could be responsible for pseudocode, or perhaps the code of individual components, but the entire implementation would be far too much work.
//! ```
//! 
//! Neither quite bubbles up to the top of the priority-stack for now. 
//! So this remains `todo!`. 
//!
