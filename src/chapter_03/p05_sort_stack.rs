//! # Sort Stack:
//!
//! Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
//! You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array).
//! The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
//!
//! Hints: # 75, #32, #43
//!
